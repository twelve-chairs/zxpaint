# ZX-Paint

## Intro
An open source project to simulate the Sinclair ZX Spectrum's screen drawing capabilities, in the style of a simple modern-ish image manipulation editor! Includes realistic pixel dimensions, and proper attribute-based colour schemes. Why? Simply because the [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) is a unique monster from the 80s that has had such a massive impact on gaming, and demo scenes with its [quirky screen drawing capabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum_graphic_modes). Even more honestly - we just wanted to become more familiar with `SDL2` to enhance our skillset for future cross-platform game and simulation software, and just happen to be huge Speccy fans! This is no DPaint, but we hope that other Speccy enthusiasts will enjoy this, too üòä

3. Basic zoom in/out ‚úÖ
4. Menu selector buttons (hover and click) ‚úÖ
5. Attributes ‚úÖ
6. Color/ink/paper selection ‚úÖ
7. View panning (maybe scroll bars) üå§Ô∏è
8. Basic shapes (line, circle) üå§Ô∏è
9. Shape filling üå§Ô∏è
10. Text üå§Ô∏è
11. Save to file üå§Ô∏è
